# CHANGELOGS


### v0.2.5
**March 8, 2026**

#### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed QuickSearch not finding newly added commands** — QuickSearch panel now reloads the database from disk each time it is shown, so commands added from the main window or QuickAdd panel appear immediately without restarting the app. Root cause: each Electron BrowserWindow maintained its own in-memory lowdb cache that was never refreshed after external writes.

---

### v0.2.4
**March 8, 2026**

#### Improvements
- **Dynamic search panel height** — QuickSearchPanel window size now adjusts based on the "Recently used items" count setting, avoiding empty space when count is small
- **Configurable panel position** — New dropdown in Settings > General to choose where QuickSearch/QuickAdd panels appear: Center (default), Top Center, Bottom Center, Top Left, Top Right, Bottom Left, Bottom Right
- Settings modal now defaults to the General tab when opened
- Release build auto-removes `latest.yml` and `.blockmap` from GitHub release assets

---

### v0.2.3
**March 6, 2026**

#### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed auto-paste and text capture for external apps** — Replaced VBS/PowerShell `SendKeys` (which used journal hooks that fail for external apps, console windows, and elevated processes) with a compiled C# helper using `keybd_event` Win32 API for reliable keystroke injection to any window
- **Fixed Quick Add first-open data not pre-filling** — Selected text from external apps now correctly appears in the Command field on first open (switched from push-based IPC to pull-based `ipcRenderer.invoke`)
- **Fixed foreground window capture timing** — HWND is now captured synchronously before the panel steals focus, ensuring paste targets the correct window

#### Improvements
- Configurable "Recently used items" count in Settings > General (1–50, default 10)
- Foreground window tracking now uses HWND instead of PID for more reliable window activation

---

### v0.2.2
**March 6, 2026**

#### New Features
- **Quick Add Panel (Alt+Z)** — Press Alt+Z (customizable) to instantly open a floating "New Command" form. Automatically captures the selected text from the active application and pre-fills the Command field. Just add a title, tags, and description, then save
- **Auto-paste to active window** — After copying a command from Quick Search, it automatically pastes into the previously focused application. Supports Windows (SendKeys), macOS (osascript), and Linux (xdotool). Can be toggled in Settings > General
- **Unsaved changes guard** — When creating or editing a command snippet, accidentally clicking the overlay, X button, or Cancel will now prompt a confirmation dialog if any fields have been modified, preventing data loss

#### Improvements
- Added Quick Add Hotkey recorder in Settings > General tab (default: Alt+Z)
- Added "Auto-paste" checkbox in Settings > General tab (enabled by default, requires auto-close to be enabled)
- Tag input in Quick Add panel supports auto-complete suggestions from existing tags

---

### v0.2.1
**March 5, 2026**

#### Improvements
- **Multi-monitor support** — Quick Search panel now appears on whichever screen your cursor is on, instead of always defaulting to the primary display

#### Bug Fixes
- Fixed white border/edge visible on the right side and bottom of the main window, and the right side of the Quick Search panel
- BrowserWindow background color now matches the active theme (light/dark) to eliminate flash-of-white on launch
- Removed `border-radius` from Quick Search panel that caused white corners in the frameless window
- Added `overflow: hidden` on `html, body` to prevent scrollbar-induced gaps

---

### v0.2.0
**March 5, 2026**

#### New Features
- **Global Hotkey + Quick Search Panel** — Press Alt+C (customizable) to open a floating search panel anywhere, search commands instantly, and copy to clipboard
- **Fuzzy Search Engine** — Replaced basic indexOf search with a multi-field weighted fuzzy search algorithm (title > command > tags > description)
- **#tag Prefix Search** — Type `#docker` to filter commands by tag, optionally followed by a search query (e.g. `#docker restart`)
- **Usage Frequency Tracking** — Commands you use often rank higher in search results (logarithmic boost with diminishing returns)
- **System Tray** — App runs in the background; close the window and it stays in the tray. Left-click to toggle, right-click for menu
- **Quick Save** — Save new command snippets directly from the search panel via the "+" button
- **Settings: General Tab** — Configure global hotkey (with live key recorder) and auto-close-after-copy behavior
- **Parameterized Commands in Quick Search** — Fill variable/choice/password parameters directly in the floating panel

#### Bug Fixes
- Fixed Electron `remote` module security vulnerability — replaced with IPC handlers
- Fixed `getAllUntaggedCommands` logic error — commands with `null` tags were not returned
- Fixed regex null-access crashes in `organizeCommands` and `commandAsHtml`
- Fixed `getCommandsContainsTag` crash when tags is null/undefined
- Fixed `queryCommand` crash when title or command is null/undefined
- Fixed XSS vulnerability in `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` — added HTML escaping via `escapeHtml` utility
- Fixed memory leak: `setInterval` for auto-backup now cleared on unmount
- Fixed memory leak: IPC listeners in `TopMenu` now removed on unmount
- Added error handling (try-catch) to all file system operations in StorageHelpers
- Fixed macOS `activate` event handler (was commented out)

#### Tech Debt / Refactoring
- **Api Singleton** — Replaced 13+ `new Api()` calls across 6 files with `Api.getInstance()`, eliminating redundant disk reads on every operation
- **Removed Moment.js** (~330 KB) — Replaced with 3 native Date utility functions
- **Removed Lodash** (~531 KB) — Replaced `forEach/forOwn/sortBy/uniq` with native JS equivalents across 4 files
- **Removed unused TypeScript** devDependency (~60 MB dev)
